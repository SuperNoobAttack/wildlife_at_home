Currently the project is looking at video of <a href='sharptailed_grouse_info.php'>sharp-tailed grouse</a>, <i>Tympanuchus phasianellus</i> to examine their nesting habits and ecology. The nest cameras have been set up up both near western North Dakota's oil fields and also within protected state lands. We recently have also begun studying two federally protected species, interior least terns, <i>Sternula antillarum</i>, and piping plovers, <i>Charadruis melodus</i>. </p>");
