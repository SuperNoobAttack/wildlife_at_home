					<td>The UND Wildlife at Home Education Middle School Module entitled <i>Impacts of Gas and Oil on Nest Success of Sharp-tailed Grouse in Western North Dakota</i> was developed to address MS-LS2-4 and LS2.A.  It asks students to construct an argument supported by empirical evidence that changes to the physical or biological components of an ecosystem affect populations by presenting students with real-world data from three study sites in Western North Dakota.  These three sites represent areas of high, medium and low intensity development of gas and oil extraction.  Students use real data collected as part of a study by UND, North Dakota Game and Fish, and Brigham Young University to identify predators captured on camera.  Students then classify their data and use it to calculate nest success rates, predation rates and types, and chick survival to make inferences about the effects of gas and oil development on the population of Sharp-tailed Grouse in Western North Dakota.  MS-LS1-6 and MS-LS1-8 are also supported because the theme of obtaining, analyzing, and communicating empirical evidence is emphasized throughout the module.</td>
