                Cameras have become common and powerful tools in the field of avian ecology, as they can be used to capture events that would be otherwise difficult to impossible to observe in any other way.  Cameras allow us to evaluate a variety of questions ranging from behaviors to interactions with other species.
                </p>
                <p>
                We need your help so we can answer the following questions:
                <ol>
                    <li> Which predators are responsible for destroying nests?</li>
                    <li> Female grouse must allocate their time between incubating the eggs and foraging; how often do they leave to forage?  How long are they away from the nest on foraging bouts?</li>
                    <li>How often do grouse defend against predators?</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                To do this, we will need to you to watch 3 minutes clips of video to identify when the grouse is on the nest, leaving the nest, off the nest, and returning the nest.
